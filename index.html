      <p id="title">My Favourite Hobby:<br>Reading!</p>
    </div>
      <p> My favourite hobby is reading fun and long books in my spare time. I've been attached to reading ever since I was 5 years old. My interest in reading was noticed by my teachers and I got to keep one of the books I was reading. It's not my favourite anymore but I'm still interested in MUCH better books. I'm 10 and my reading age is that of a 16 year old! Cool, isn't it? I love reading so much, sometimes I just like to lay on my bed real early, and just read until it's time for me to get up. I also love my school because it lets me read after I've done all the work I'm supposed to. I like books with barely any pictures because they let you IMAGINE what's happening inside the book. It's just shown to you because sometimes that can be quite dissapointing. Bottomline, reading books is my favourite hobby!</p>
